# Commandordle

### *Note: Dictionary needs updating. Feel free to add any words you please in filteredwords.txt*

Commandordle is a command-line word guessing game inspired by Wordle. The player has 6 attempts to guess a randomly chosen 5-letter word. After each guess, the game provides color-coded feedback for each letter:

- **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position
- **Yellow**: Correct letter in the wrong position
- **Red**: Incorrect letter

## Features

- Random word selection from a filtered word list
- Input validation against allowed words
- Color-coded feedback using [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
- Cross-platform terminal clearing

## Setup

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. The game requires the `colorama` package. If not installed, the game will attempt to install it automatically.

## Files

- [`commandordle.py`](commandordle.py): Main game logic.
- [`filterer.py`](filterer.py): Script to generate `filteredwords.txt` from `unfilteredwords.txt`.
- [`unfilteredwords.txt`](unfilteredwords.txt): Source word list.
- [`filteredwords.txt`](filteredwords.txt): Filtered list of valid 5-letter words (generated by `filterer.py`).

## Usage

1. **Prepare the word list** (if filteredwords.txt IS NOT ALREADY IN YOUR FOLDER):

   ```sh
   python filterer.py
   ```

2. **Start the game:**

   ```sh
   python commandordle.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts to guess the word.**

## Notes

- If `filteredwords.txt` already exists, `filterer.py` will not overwrite it.
- The game only accepts guesses that are valid words from the filtered list.
