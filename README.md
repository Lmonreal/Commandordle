# Commandordle

### *Note: Dictionary needs updating. Feel free to add any words you please in filteredwords.txt*

Commandordle is a command-line word guessing game inspired by Wordle. The player has 6 attempts to guess a randomly chosen 5-letter word. After each guess, the game provides color-coded feedback for each letter:

- **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position
- **Yellow**: Correct letter in the wrong position
- **Grey**: Incorrect letter

## Features

- Random word selection from a filtered word list
- Input validation against allowed words
- Color-coded feedback using [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
- Cross-platform terminal clearing
